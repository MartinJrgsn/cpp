# cpp
My C++

First of all; to setup Visual Studio Code on my Linux/GNU machine, I followed this tutorial:
\nhttps://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux

It helped me to configure the Code Editor to be capable of both compiling, and running the code from within a terminal in Visual Studio Code. Much like I have been used to, using Visual Studio Enteprise/Community 2019.
